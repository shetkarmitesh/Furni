 we are developing the project ecommerce website of furni related to the furniture 
  we have downloaded the tempalate realted to furniture 

  now we have to setup that template in furni project

  we are  creating virtual environment for this project so we can isolate python installs , and pip packages and also used to manage packages allow developers to control software dependencies in Python code.

  Install virtual environment using : pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

  creating virtual environment : python -m venv myenv

  activating the virtaul environment : .\myenv\Scripts\activate

  We are done with our virtaul environment now we have to setup django

  instll django : pip install Django

  creating project  : django-admin startproject FURNI 
 project has been created move to the project : cd furni

 lets test the project is running or not using : python manage.py runserver

 creating app : python manage.py startapp furniapp

 we have to mapped the urls in app for that we have to create the urls.py

 In urls.py file we haved define the home page as index.html 
 the we have to define the index function in views to render or display message 

 but if we want to go home page we have to define in project urls also about the new app furniapp :  path('', include ("furniapp.urls")), 
 for that we have imported include along with path

 and the website is rendering to the index page but it is not rendering because we haved to define in settings.py file the template directory
'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],

 now we have to link the css and other static files 
 
STATICFILES_DIRS=[
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'assets')

now create folder static and paste all folder like css js

run command to : python manage.py collectstatic

now we are ready with the css, js other static files but it doesnt affect the index.files because we have to make all the links static in index.html  using jinja format
1. {% load static %}
2. make the all the links static by : href="{% static 'favicon.png'%} "

we are able to see the changes and mapped all the links

for images : 
        for img we should define : {% static "img/place" as baseUrl %}
        static and path as baseUrl as variable
        <img src="{{ baseUrl }}/{{ dest.img }}" alt="asfasdfasdfadf">

Lets define the database 
In settings.py file database secttion :

        'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'furnitureDetails',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'zxcvbnm1234567890$',
        'HOST':'localhost',
        'PORT':'3306' 
            }
 
and download MySQLclient : pip install mysqlclient

define models : 
        class furniture(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField (max_length=100)
    # img would be upload it will not stored in database so we have to path here to access
    img = models.ImageField(upload_to='pics')
    price = models.IntegerField()
    offer = models.BooleanField(default=False)

we have to declare our application name in settings.py : 
    # defnine app
    'furniapp.apps.FurniappConfig'

created meet with an error like cannot use ImageFeild because Pillow is not installed
    pip install Pillow

Now we are done with the model now we have to migrate it with database by :  python manage.py makemigrations

migrations created with : 
         furniapp\migrations\0001_initial.py
        - Create model furniture
To migrate we haved run command : python manage.py sqlmigrate travello 0001

        -- 
        -- Create model furniture
        --
        CREATE TABLE `furniapp_furniture` (`id` bigint AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL, `img` varchar(100) NOT NULL, `price` integer NOT NULL, `offer` bool NOT NULL);


it have created an query to create table and then run command : python manage.py migrate 
To applay changes
created table successfully

lets create the admin panel to add furnitureDetails

 now by url : localhost:8000/admin 
we can access administrator page and it will asked for authentication and we dont have username and password 

and to access that page we have to create super user : python manage.py createsuperuser

superuser created successfully : admin


Now we want to add furniture by admin portal 

It can be done just by registering the furniture model in admin.py 
 from .models import furniture
# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(furniture)



************ Add and Fetch data from Database ************

to add images from database we have to create folder media which will store the uploaded images
In setting.py define Media_root and assign path of media folder

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')


We have to specify the url we are going to use in views


# In to make images dynamic we are creating folder media and storing the images which are uploaded
urlpatterns = urlpatterns + static(settings.MEDIA_URL,document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

to resolve th error
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

create object dest and pass :         furni= furniture.objects.all()

we are getting all details except img because the declared is for static data 

for dynamic : 
<img src="{{ dest.img.url }}" >
for global url 


**************** making all links working *************
adding others remaining link of about,shop,services,contact us etc 

for rendering from index to about, shop we have  to decalare in app/urls.py about the page and in index file : <li><a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'about'%}">About us</a></li>
    href="{% url 'about'%}"
all urls mapping is done 

Tommorow we will do the dyanmic part for  furnitureDetails



Icons were not visible because the 
		<link href =  "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
this link of font awesome was made static 

we are done with testimonails dynamic team members dynamic content 

now wroking on login register 
created login and register option in index.html and passing the url


**************modal making***********

<li><div class="center"><button type="button"  data-toggle="modal" data-target="#show-login">Login</button></div>
// we will see that part further



done with mapping of Login, logout, register 

Encountering th error as we are rendering to pages like shop ,services etc but on webpage it highlights the part of home not updating as per the page



lets do the part of verifying the password and confirm password : done


************** Add item to cart *******************
***** create Ooperation ******
In the furniture list we are having an anchor tag for adding item to cart so we use it to add it in cart by redering that page to to addToCart with furniture id like
<a class="product-item" href="{% url 'add_to_cart' furniture.id %} ">
with url we can pass id   
Then we have mapped the url and defined add_to_cart function in view 
Only login users should able to add items to cart so we have used : @login_required
it will denied access and throw error if without login user tries to add items 

to store the items we have created model name as Cart_Item where we have passed the product and customer details using the foriegn key 
def __str__(self):
        # return f'{self.customer} | {self.quantity} x {self.productName}'
        return f'{self.customer}'
it used to show the headline in admin portale for cart_item object

Then we have checked that item is already added in the cart or not 
now then we want to pass the message that item is added successfully
for that we have found the about the sweetalert library  :  https://github.com/Atrox/sweetify-django
for that we have install : pip install sweetify
In settings.py  installed apps ':  sweetify',
In html code  : Next add the following lines to the bottom of your layout/base template:
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/limonte-sweetalert2/11.6.5/sweetalert2.all.min.js"></script>

        {% load sweetify %}
        {% sweetify %}
IN views.py : 
            import sweetify
            sweetify.success(request, 'Item Added', timer=1000)

Done with the alert 

************ Now manage the cart ****************

***** Read Ooperation ******
now to display the cart items on cart.html of login user we required users id which will get by request.user.id
using that we will fetch the data of selected items
and dispalied that data in cart.html 

***** Delete Ooperation ******
Now to delete the selected cart we ahave an anchor tag so by midifying it as 
         <td><a href="{% url 'remove_cart_item' cart_detail.id %} " class="btn btn-black btn-sm">X</a></td>

passed the item id to delete fetech and delete that item
         cart_item = Cart_Item.objects.filter(id=cart_id, customer=request.user)
        if cart_item.exists():
        cart_item.delete()
***** Update Ooperation ******
for that we will require the item id and the quantity updated
we have button update cart : <button class="btn btn-black btn-sm btn-block" onclick="location.href='/update_cart_item/{{cart_detail.id}}/{{valueId}}/'">Update Cart</button>
where we have to pass the multiple values traditional was incomplete so we have new way to pass the values 
now the updated the values are not getting us for that :
we can use the ajax or jquery to update the quantity in the database 
In custom.js we have created a click function to fetch the quantity and product id and to send the data to update_cart_item 



$('.change_qauntity').click(function (e) {
	e.preventDefault();
	var product_id = $(this).closest(('.product_data')).find('.product_id').val();
	var product_quantity = $(this).closest(('.product_data')).find('.product_quantity').val();
	var token = $('input[name = csrfmiddlewaretoken]').val();
	console.log("hiii");
	$.ajax({
			method :"POST",
			url : "/update_cart_item",
			data : {
			  'product_id':product_id,
			  'product_qty':product_quantity,
			  csrfmiddlewaretoken: token
			},success : function(response){
			 
			}
		  });

where the change_qauntity is the class assign to the buttons of increasing and decreasing items : <button class="btn btn-outline-black change_qauntity decrease" type="button">&minus;</button>
in the main class product_data the product search the required data closed to the main class and serches class product_id,quantity and csrf token to bypass the url
In the ajax format we haved call the method , passed the url and data ;

Updated the update , continue and total price and rediect to the checkout

************* checkout Page **************
Working on  Your Order for that fetching the order details from order models
